# Pi Pico SDK Project Template

**Your project goes here!** This is a template for projects that use the Raspberry Pi Pico C SDK.

It contains the following:

- SDK included as a Git submodule
- CMakeLists.txt set up for a Pico executable
- VSCode configurations for C/C++ and the OpenOCD Cortex Debugger
- .gitignore files
- This file!

You should:

- Replace `LICENSE` with a license applicable to your project (or at the very least, change the name - I do not want your copyright)
- Run `chmod +x configure.sh` and then `./configure.sh` to set up the submodules
- Replace this file
- Profit!
